**Proposal**

For my audio narrative, I wanted to pursue something that is familiar to me. I also wanted to choose a scene where the sounds are distinct to that location. Because of these two self-imposed criteria, I plan to recreate the experience of going to the gym and beginning a workout. To begin the narrative, I will start with checking in at the gym: saying "hello" to the worker checking people in, swiping my ID card, being told "have a nice workout" by the worker. The entire background of this narrative will be gym sounds, which I will record. These sounds will grow louder as I enter the gym. Then, the scene will move to unzipping my backpack, putting my shoes  and lacing them up, then sliding my bag into a locker. My next idea is to recreate the sound of putting in headphones and listening to a workout playlist. The only difficulty with this idea is finding music that will not violate any fair use or copyright laws. If I can find music that will be fairly available, I would tune down the sound of background gym noises. I also plan on including the sound of someone asking if I'm using some weights or a machine, quietly at first because my music is so loud, then louder after I cut out the sound of my music.

**1/26 Audio Narrative Preview Reflection**

I am on the right track in terms of having my ideas and sources/sounds that I need in line, but I am struggling with some of the features of Audacity. I am trying to move a track to a later time in the audio narrative, but do not have the Time Shift tool or ability to grab and drag but he rounded top heading of the clip. I was able to figure out how to fade in my background noise sound to mimic what a person hears when they are walking to the gym. At this stage, I am more comfortable using Adobe Audituin, but also know that I am just unfamiliar with the features and uses of Audacity. My next steps include getting more of the recordings--the ones I need to do myself, I mean. I also need to figure out how to move clips throughout a track because this is my biggest challenge at this stage in my project. I plan on using a male voice for the gym worker, so I might ask my dad. I figure that a male voice sounds most unlike mine and I want listeners to easily differentiate between "characters." This means I will also need to choose a voice that is different from mine for the person asking me if I am using a machine/set of weights. One concern I have is that I followed the steps in the uplaoding a preview aup3 and mp3 file video, but am not seeing them in my repository. I'm assuming this just means that they are still uplaoding because they are large files and I uplaoded not too long before typing this reflection. I hope to play around with some more effects, like turn my music completely to the left or right to mimic me taking out one earbud to listen to the person asking to use weights/a machine. 

**Lesson 6: In Class Reflection**

I am excited for my project to feel as realistic as possible. I want to recreate exactly what I hear when I am at the gym working out. Every small, subtle sound is influential in an audio story and I am doing my best to consider each one of those. Something I am worried about is my use of Audacity as the audio editing studio/platform. I fear that my lack of skills when it comes to using it may negatively affect my grade despite having really exciting ideas that I know are achievable. 

Something that makes an audio narrative stand out is a feeling of fullness, like every little background noise is included to make the soundscape as realistic as possible. Seamless tranisitons and effects that add to the whole narrative make for a memorable audio story as well. Cohesion is an important aspect of good audio narratives. 

**Reflection 1/31**

I am very happy with how my audio narrative has turned out thus far. I used my dads voice for the gym employee and my cousins voice for the person in the gym who turns out to be in a class with me. All audio except the card sliding, reader confirming my swipe, and techno music (music in my "earphones") was recorded by me. The part I am most content with is the sounds of taking off my backpack, unzipping it, taking my shoes out, putting them on and lacing them up. Each of these sounds were individually recorded by me, though they flow together rather seamlessly. I also tried something new and used the left versus right speaker audio to mimic the sound of putting earphones on each individual ear. I used this came tactic to replicate taking off one earphone side and only having music play in the other side. 

Where to go from here: I definitely need to fine-tune my audio narrative. I plan on going back in to adjust the volumes of each clip so that it all makes sense and clips are loud enough when they need to be heard and quiet enough when they are not the main focus. I hope to get some feedback from classmates or peers outside of the class. Getting different perspectives always proves to be astronomically helpful in my editing/revisioning phase. I am considering adding another section where I fill up my water bottle since my audio narrative is just over two minutes. 

I was correct that audacity is a learning curve. It is much easier now than it was in my last reflective update. I still personally prefer Adobe Audition, but I am happy to know another audio editing platform for future use. One small thing- I’m nervous that my GitHub desktop app is not pushing my files through to my repository. It’s normally fine after I quit the application and redo the action, but I still worry things are not showing up and that I’m not receiving credit for my work. 

**Audio narrative is listed under "digital media audio narrative_1.30.real.aup3" with the summary "preview 2"**

**FINAL REFLECTION**

I am happy with this cut of my audio narrative. I feel as though I met baseline criteria and reached for some aspirational effects with left/right pan and a clear ending by fading out the audio. Some of my feedback stated that the location was not confirmed until a bit later in the narrative. Personally, I like the effect that keeping the listener guessing until later in the narrative has; it entices the listener to continue listening through the entire soundscape to determine where it is taking place. Each clip is individually recorded and layered together. I am happy with the seamlessness of the two conversations I have in my narrative. I had one of my friends listen to my narrative and she asked me if I recorded it in real time as opposed to having individual conversation clips. I really enjoyed recording and editing this project. I love working with sound and the opportunities for creativity it affords. I hope to do more work with sound in the future.
