**Proposal**
For my audio narrative, I wanted to pursue something that is familiar to me. I also wanted to choose a scene where the sounds are distinct to that location. Because of these two self-imposed criteria, I plan to recreate the experience of going to the gym and beginning a workout. To begin the narrative, I will start with checking in at the gym: saying "hello" to the worker checking people in, swiping my ID card, being told "have a nice workout" by the worker. The entire background of this narrative will be gym sounds, which I will record. These sounds will grow louder as I enter the gym. Then, the scene will move to unzipping my backpack, putting my shoes  and lacing them up, then sliding my bag into a locker. My next idea is to recreate the sound of putting in headphones and listening to a workout playlist. The only difficulty with this idea is finding music that will not violate any fair use or copyright laws. If I can find music that will be fairly available, I would tune down the sound of background gym noises. I also plan on including the sound of someone asking if I'm using some weights or a machine, quietly at first because my music is so loud, then louder after I cut out the sound of my music.
