**2/7/23 Reflection on Sound as a Composing Media**

Sound as a form of media allows freedon of interpretation for both listener and creator. The creator has the ability to create an atmosphere/scene that does not exist while the listener has the freedom to interpret an audio project in their own way, though this way might be different from the intended. Sound also makes it easy to alter real-time scenes. The freedom it affords may also be interpreted as a shortcoming of the media. 

Audacity does not allow the same editing features as other sound editing software, i.e. Adobe Audition. Personally, I find Audition to be a much easier platform to use when editing sound. The features on Audition are also more accessible to the user. One thing I liked about Audition was how easy it was to save our aup.3 and mp3 files directly to our GitHub repositories. I also especially like the left/right pan feature of Audacity and used it a few times in my audio project. One trick I learned is that users have to change where the audio output comes from when editing and using headphones. I also learned that the audio must be fully stopped to be able to edit/move clips.
